					<p>Located in North Minneapolis off of West Broadway, our mission is to cultivate a love and knowledge of the performing arts so that young people will discover their unique gifts, develop their depth of character and imagine new possibilities in their lives.
					Drawing on both established and blossoming relationships with major artists in New York's Broadway scene, the Lundstrum Center continues to foster a unique and unparalleled connection to the country's center of musical theater. It is with this crucial relationship that Lundstrum Center aspires to become a world-class training center for those with Broadway ambitions. The opportunities this Broadway to Broadway network affords are truly invaluable to a largely underserved and overlooked community.</p>

				<h1>Our History</h1>
				<div class="text-background clearfix">
					<img src="images/dance2.jpeg" height="200" weight="300">
					<p>The Lundstrum Studio began in the 1920s when a 15-year-old named Dorothy Lundstrum took over the Ascension School of Dance with her two sisters Lorraine and Marion. Dorothy launched what proved to be an amazing legacy on the north side of Minneapolis. Thousands of children and youth growing up in this community studied dance, charm and fashion there. As the Twin Cities' suburbs developed, parents drove their children great distances to study with Dorothy Lundstrum. When she passed away in November 1998, North Minneapolis lost a principal arts benefactor. For over 80 years, she mentored thousands of students, teaching positive behavior, self-worth, and good citizenship, as well as dance and movement. Despite the increasing economic challenges, rising poverty, and crime in the North Minneapolis neighborhood, Dorothy never wavered in her commitment to bring exceptional opportunities for success to her students.</p>

					<p>In 2004, the Lundstrum Center had to leave its original home at Ascension School due to the school's expansion. The Center struggled to find a permanent space for its work that would also allow it to continue to serve the North Minneapolis community. Although this time was difficult, they did not give up -- their students inspired them to continue. After renting space and running programs at 3 separate locations, finally in August 2006 the Lundstrum Center purchased a brand new building located at 1617 North Second Street.</p>
